# TOP_landing_page
Project: Landing Page at the end of TOP Flexbox module
Updated 18 October 2023

I decided to convert this project to a silly goat-related theme from the original boilerplate example set up in the assignment documentation. It's been augmented with little text and image animations, tool tips, and is decently mobile responsive.

It's not perfect, but it's a heck of a lot cleaner than my first attmept. During my first iteration of this project, going back to thoroughly read the documentation provided by TOP proved to be the key to solving this puzzle and improving my understanding of flexbox. Special thank you to W3Schools and CSSTricks for their documentation as well. 

I had great fun riddling this out, especially as I enhanced beyond the original, basic scope of the project, and I hope you enjoy viewing my solution. 

Thanks!
