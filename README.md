# TOP_landing_page
Project: Landing Page at the end of TOP Flexbox module

I decided to convert this project to a silly goat-related theme from the original boilerplate example set up in the assignment documentation. 

It's not perfect, but it's a heck of a lot cleaner than my first attmept. Going back to thoroughly read the documentation provided by TOP proved to be the key to solving this puzzle and understanding flexbox, for me. 

I had great fun riddling this out, and I hope you enjoy viewing my solution to this project. 

Thanks!
